Instagram Bot

This bot uses Selenium Webdriver to like, comment, and follow accounts from a selected hashtag.  Additionally, it finds people you are following that do not follow back, and then unfollows them.  It allows for scalable growth of an Instagram page by increasing an account's activity and engagement.


Run the code by cd into the dir and then using 'python bot.py'.

It iterates through 25 pictures and likes, comments, and follows them, but this number can be altered by changing the for loop.
